# Product Requirements Document: Local Project Setup Documentation

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive local setup documentation in the project's README. The goal is to enable developers and testers to quickly and reliably set up the project on their local machines, regardless of whether they use macOS or Windows. The documentation should cover installation, running the application, environment configuration, project structure, and troubleshooting.

## 2. Goals
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up the project locally on macOS and Windows.
- Ensure all prerequisites and dependencies are documented.
- Include a project structure overview to help users understand the codebase.
- Document environment variable setup using `.env.local`.
- Offer troubleshooting tips for common issues (especially with Next.js and Node.js).
- Use a standard, easy-to-follow README format.

## 3. User Stories
- As a **developer**, I want to follow the README to install dependencies and run the project locally so I can start contributing quickly.
- As a **tester**, I want to set up the project on my machine to verify features and bug fixes.
- As a **new team member**, I want to understand the project structure and configuration so I can onboard efficiently.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The README must specify all prerequisites, including Node.js and npm versions (as defined in the project).
2. The README must provide platform-specific instructions for both macOS and Windows.
3. The README must include commands to install dependencies (e.g., `npm install`).
4. The README must describe how to run the application in development mode (e.g., `npm run dev`).
5. The README must explain how to set up the `.env.local` file, including required variables and example values.
6. The README must include a section describing the project's directory structure and the purpose of key files/folders.
7. The README must provide troubleshooting tips for common setup issues, especially those related to Next.js and Node.js.
8. The README must use a clear, standard format (headings, code blocks, etc.).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Production deployment instructions
- Advanced configuration or customization
- CI/CD setup
- Third-party service integration details (unless required for local setup)

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)
- Use Markdown best practices: headings, lists, code blocks, and links.
- Optionally include badges (e.g., Node version, build status) and a table of contents.
- Screenshots or diagrams may be added for clarity but are not required.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)
- Ensure compatibility with both macOS and Windows command-line tools.
- Reference the `package.json` for required Node.js and npm versions.
- Provide example `.env.local` content if possible.

## 8. Success Metrics
- Developers and testers can set up the project locally without external help.
- Reduced setup-related support requests.
- Positive feedback from new team members regarding onboarding experience.

## 9. Open Questions
- Are there any platform-specific dependencies or scripts that need special handling?
- Should the README include links to additional resources (e.g., Next.js docs, Node.js installation guides)?
- Are there any security considerations for sharing example `.env.local` values?
