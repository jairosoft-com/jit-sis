Document Version: 1.1  
Date: June 1, 2025  
Feature Name: Student Admission & Profile Management  
Target Filename for Repository: prd-student-admission-profile-management.md

## **1\. Introduction/Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the "Student Admission & Profile Management" module for the JIT.edu.ph Student Information System (SIS).

**Problem:** JIT.edu.ph currently lacks a centralized digital system for managing student information. The existing processes (assumed to be manual or disparate) are inefficient, prone to errors, and make data retrieval and management cumbersome.

**Feature Description:** The "Student Admission & Profile Management" module will serve as the foundational component for the new SIS. It will enable authorized school personnel to digitally register new students, maintain their profiles, and ensure each student has a unique identifier. This module aims to be the single source of truth for core student data within the SIS.

**Goal of this MVP:** To provide an efficient, reliable, and user-friendly method for digitally capturing, storing, searching, and managing essential student information, thereby streamlining the initial stages of student data handling at JIT.edu.ph.

## **2\. Goals**

The specific objectives for the MVP of this module are:

* To enable authorized personnel (Administrators, Admissions Officers, Data Entry Clerks) to digitally register new students with all essential information.  
* To provide a centralized, secure, and easily accessible digital profile for each student.  
* To ensure each student is automatically assigned a unique, system-generated identifier upon registration.  
* To allow for quick and easy searching and retrieval of student profiles by authorized personnel.  
* To permit authorized personnel to update student profile information accurately as needed.  
* To significantly reduce the time, effort, and potential for errors associated with manual student data entry and management.

## **3\. User Stories**

### **Administrator:**

* **US-A01:** As an Administrator, I want to configure the system settings for student ID generation (e.g., prefix, sequence format) so that IDs are consistent and meet school requirements.  
* **US-A02:** As an Administrator, I want to manage user accounts and assign roles (Administrator, Admissions Officer, Data Entry Clerk) so that access to student data is appropriately controlled and secure.  
* **US-A03:** As an Administrator, I want to be able to perform all actions available to Admissions Officers and Data Entry Clerks (register, search, view, edit profiles) so that I can oversee, support, and troubleshoot the admission and data management process.  
* **US-A04:** As an Administrator, I want to easily input all required details for a new student through a clear form so that their record is created accurately and efficiently.  
* **US-A05:** As an Administrator, I want to quickly find an existing student's profile by searching their full name or unique Student ID so that I can verify, update their information, or avoid duplicates.  
* **US-A06:** As an Administrator, I want the system to automatically generate and prominently display a unique ID for each new student so that their records are distinct and easily trackable.  
* **US-A07:** As an Administrator, I want to be able to soft delete (mark as inactive) a student record if it was created in error or if a student leaves, so that the record is hidden from active lists but retained for historical purposes.

### **Admissions Officer:**

* **US-AO01:** As an Admissions Officer, I want to register new students by entering their personal and contact details into a clear and straightforward form so that I can efficiently process new admissions.  
* **US-AO02:** As an Admissions Officer, I want to search for existing student profiles before creating a new one (e.g., by name, DOB) to avoid creating duplicate records and maintain data integrity.  
* **US-AO03:** As an Admissions Officer, I want to view and verify the information of newly registered students so that I can ensure accuracy before further processing or enrollment.  
* **US-AO04:** As an Admissions Officer, I want to be able to edit student information during the initial admission phase if corrections or updates are needed so that records are accurate from the start.

### **Data Entry Clerk:**

* **US-DEC01:** As a Data Entry Clerk, I want to input student information from provided physical or digital forms into the system accurately and quickly using a simple interface so that student records are created in a timely manner.  
* **US-DEC02:** As a Data Entry Clerk, I want a simple data entry form with clear field labels and basic validation (e.g., for required fields, date formats) so that I can minimize errors during input.  
* **US-DEC03:** As a Data Entry Clerk, I want to be able to view the profiles I have created or have been assigned to update so that I can manage my workload and verify my entries.  
* **US-DEC04:** As a Data Entry Clerk, I want to be able to edit student profiles I have access to (any profile they can view) if corrections or updates are identified so that data accuracy is maintained.

## **4\. Functional Requirements**

### **FR1: User Roles & Permissions**

* **FR1.1:** The system must support at least three distinct user roles: Administrator, Admissions Officer, and Data Entry Clerk.  
* **FR1.2:** **Administrator Role:**  
  * Shall have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update) access to all student profiles.  
  * Shall have the ability to **soft delete** (mark as inactive) student profiles. Hard deletion is out of scope for MVP.  
  * Shall have access to system configuration settings for this module (e.g., Student ID format).  
  * Shall be able to manage user accounts and role assignments for this module.  
* **FR1.3:** **Admissions Officer Role:**  
  * Shall have Create, Read, and Update access to student profiles.  
  * Soft delete permissions for student profiles shall be restricted for MVP (i.e., performed by an Administrator).  
* **FR1.4:** **Data Entry Clerk Role:**  
  * Shall have Create, Read, and Update access to any student profile they can view.  
  * Soft delete permissions for student profiles shall be restricted for MVP (i.e., performed by an Administrator).

### **FR2: Student Registration**

* **FR2.1:** The system must provide an intuitive digital form for authorized users (Administrators, Admissions Officers, Data Entry Clerks) to register new students.  
* **FR2.2:** The registration form must capture the following **mandatory** fields:  
  * Full Name: First Name (text), Middle Name (text, optional), Last Name (text).  
  * Date of Birth (date picker, validated format e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).  
  * Gender (dropdown or radio buttons: e.g., Male, Female, Other, Prefer not to say).  
  * Primary Contact Number (Parent/Guardian, validated phone format).  
  * Home Address (structured fields: Street Address, City, State/Province, Postal Code, Country \- dropdown for Country).  
  * Emergency Contact Person (Full Name \- text).  
  * Emergency Contact Phone Number (validated phone format).  
* **FR2.3:** The registration form may capture the following **optional** fields:  
  * Secondary Contact Number (Parent/Guardian, validated phone format).  
  * Email Address (Parent/Guardian, validated email format).  
  * Student Email Address (if applicable, validated email format).  
* **FR2.4:** The system must perform basic client-side and server-side validation for all input fields (e.g., required fields are not empty, correct data types, valid formats for dates, emails, phone numbers). Standard common validations will be used.  
* **FR2.5:** Upon submission, the system should provide clear feedback (success message or specific error messages).

### **FR3: Unique Student ID Generation**

* **FR3.1:** The system must automatically generate a unique student ID upon successful registration of a new student.  
* **FR3.2:** The format of the student ID should be configurable by an Administrator (e.g., prefix JIT-, year YYYY-, sequential number XXXX). For MVP, if full configuration is complex, a default fixed prefix (e.g., JIT-) followed by a unique sequential number is acceptable.  
* **FR3.3:** The generated student ID must be guaranteed unique across all student records in the system.  
* **FR3.4:** The student ID shall be non-editable by any user after it has been generated and assigned.  
* **FR3.5:** The student ID must be prominently displayed on the student's profile page and in relevant lists.

### **FR4: Student Profile Management**

* **FR4.1:** Each student must have a dedicated profile page displaying all their registered information and their unique student ID.  
* **FR4.2:** Authorized users (based on their roles and permissions) must be able to view student profiles. Soft-deleted profiles should generally be hidden from standard views/searches unless explicitly searched for by an Administrator.  
* **FR4.3:** Authorized users (based on their roles and permissions) must be able to edit existing student profile information through a form similar to the registration form.  
* **FR4.4:** The system **must** maintain a basic audit trail for significant changes to student profile information (e.g., field changed, old value, new value, user making the change, timestamp). This is a requirement for MVP.

### **FR5: Student Search Functionality**

* **FR5.1:** The system must provide a basic search functionality accessible to all authorized users to find student profiles. Administrators should have an option to include soft-deleted records in their search.  
* **FR5.2:** Users should be able to search by at least:  
  * Student Full Name (any part: First, Middle, or Last Name).  
  * Unique Student ID.  
* **FR5.3:** Search results should be displayed in a clear list format, showing key identifying information (e.g., Full Name, Student ID, Date of Birth). Soft-deleted records, if shown to an Admin, should be clearly indicated.  
* **FR5.4:** Users must be able to click on a search result to navigate directly to the corresponding student's full profile page.  
* **FR5.5:** If a search yields no results, a clear "No students found" message should be displayed.

## **5\. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for MVP)**

The following features and functionalities are explicitly **out of scope** for this MVP:

* Online application portal for students or parents to self-register or submit applications.  
* Uploading, storage, and management of student-related documents (e.g., birth certificates, photos, previous academic transcripts, medical records).  
* Complex, multi-stage admission approval workflows or status tracking beyond basic record creation.  
* Direct, automated integration with other existing school systems for data import/export (e.g., accounting, library). Manual CSV import/export is also out of scope for this module's MVP (may be part of overall SIS Phase 2).  
* Advanced reporting, dashboards, or analytics on admission data (beyond simple search results or lists).  
* Student or Parent portal access to view or manage profile information (this is a separate future module).  
* Management of student fees, financial information, or billing.  
* Class enrollment, course assignment, or subject allocation (these belong to separate modules as per the SIS roadmap).  
* Communication tools (e.g., internal messaging, email notifications to students/parents).  
* Hard deletion of student records.

## **6\. Design Considerations**

* **User Interface (UI):**  
  * The UI must be clean, intuitive, and user-friendly, minimizing clicks and simplifying data entry tasks.  
  * Forms should be well-structured with clear labels, appropriate input types (e.g., date pickers), and clear indications for mandatory fields (e.g., asterisks).  
  * Consistent navigation and placement of common actions (e.g., Save, Cancel, Edit buttons).  
* **Branding:**  
  * The design should incorporate the official branding of JIT.edu.ph, including its logo and color scheme (refer to [https://jit.edu.ph](https://jit.edu.ph) for visual guidelines).  
* **Accessibility:**  
  * The system should adhere to basic web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level A or AA where feasible) to ensure usability for users with disabilities. This includes keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and screen reader compatibility for form elements.  
* **Responsiveness (Basic):**  
  * While a fully mobile-optimized experience might be for later phases, the MVP should be usable on standard desktop and laptop screen sizes. Basic responsiveness to prevent horizontal scrolling on common tablet sizes is desirable.

## **7\. Technical Considerations**

* **Validation:** Robust client-side and server-side validation must be implemented for all data inputs to ensure data integrity and security. Standard common validation rules will be applied.  
* **Security:**  
  * Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).  
  * Ensure secure storage of student data, including considerations for data at rest and in transit.  
  * Role-based access control must be strictly enforced.  
* **Platform:** The application will be web-based, accessible through modern web browsers (e.g., latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).  
* **Student ID Uniqueness:** The mechanism for generating unique student IDs must be robust and scalable to prevent collisions.  
* **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages should be implemented throughout the module.  
* **Soft Deletes:** Implement a mechanism to mark records as inactive (soft delete) rather than permanently removing them from the database. This typically involves adding an is\_active boolean flag or a deleted\_at timestamp to the student record.  
* **Audit Trail:** Implement a simple logging mechanism for changes to key student profile fields. This could be a separate table linking to the student ID, recording the field changed, old value, new value, timestamp, and user ID of the person who made the change.

## **8\. Success Metrics**

The success of the "Student Admission & Profile Management" module MVP will be measured by:

* **Adoption Rate:** Number of new student records successfully created and actively managed via the system by authorized personnel within the first month of deployment. Target: 100% of new admissions processed through the system.  
* **Task Completion Rate:** Administrators, Admissions Officers, and Data Entry Clerks can successfully complete core tasks (register student, search student, view profile, edit profile) without errors or needing excessive support. Target: \>95% success rate.  
* **Efficiency Gain:** Qualitative feedback from users indicating a reduction in time and effort required to register and manage student information compared to previous methods. Quantitative measurement if a baseline exists.  
* **Data Accuracy:** Reduction in data entry errors compared to previous methods (can be assessed through spot checks or feedback on correction frequency).  
* **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback gathered through informal discussions or simple surveys with the primary users (Administrators, Admissions Officers, Data Entry Clerks) regarding ease of use, clarity, and overall helpfulness of the module.  
* **System Stability:** No critical bugs or system crashes encountered during core operations within the first month of use.  
* **Audit Trail Utility:** Confirmation from Administrators that the basic audit trail provides useful information for tracking changes.

## **9\. Open Questions (Resolved for MVP)**

* **Audit Trail for MVP:** **Resolved.** A basic audit trail (FR4.4 \- who changed what, when) **is a requirement** for MVP.  
* **Student Record Deletion:** **Resolved.** For MVP, student records will be **soft deleted** (marked as inactive but retained in the database). This action will primarily be performed by Administrators.  
* **Initial Data Migration:** **Resolved.** There is **no initial data migration** required for the MVP launch.  
* **Specific Validation Rules:** **Resolved.** Standard common validation rules will be used. No school-specific validation rules have been identified for MVP.  
* **Definition of "Manageable" for Data Entry Clerk Updates:** **Resolved.** For MVP, Data Entry Clerks will have update access to **any profile they can view**, similar to Admissions Officers.
